#### I. *Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.*

Yet the law’s origin was the space\
Where the sound barrier was broken.

My father prepared me for the worst,\
Fully knowing he would succumb to the\
Gravity of a life-seeking universe.

The year 2067,\
Our truck cut through cornfields,\
Dust bowling over pins of maize—\
Survivors of a blight which\
Folded population like diseased leaves,\
Pinched oxygen like pressed dashes\
Of a morse code.

The sandstorm trickled from ceiling cracks\
Leaving ghost shadows on the bedroom floor.\
Father said they were gravitational variations,\
So easily deciphered\
As binary code into coordinates.

We followed the ghosts under moonlight,\
Searchlights trailing arcs towards bolted gates\
Where secrets of spacetime collapsed into\
Physical cosmology and the Gravity Equation.

"STAY"

The ghost whispered through bookshelves,\
Words fell like birds bound with leather.\

My fingers graced his sleeve\
As I was pulled away.

Father’s figure faded into the distance.\
I broke loose and tore after his truck\
As he left me for the last time.

Our twin wristwatches counted down\
Each second of his abandonment,\
Lives diverging into relative times,\
An hourglass-shaped promise of his return.

#### II. *Nothing is as easy as it looks.*

*Endurance* passed through the wormhole\
Like a paperclip puncturing a stipple\
Through folded paper.

On Miller’s planet,\
Time was a flowing estuary\
Each hour seven years of mine.\
Waves threatened to relinquish his spacecraft\
While we drowned in oxygen-less air.

Even during humanity’s struggle for survival\
Father was a skeptic of love,\
Unable to trust the multi-dimensionality\
Of something he could not yet grasp.

Brand told him otherwise,\
Weeping as I did when he steered the craft away\
In the same flawed manner\
As when he first left Earth’s trajectory for Plan B,\
Which really was always Plan A.

I solved the equation\
Only to realize he took the key.

Father left us to die with no hope for humanity,\
Beyond embers of a gravity equation\
Unreachable within a black hole.

On Mann’s planet,\
Lazarus awakened from cryostasis.\
I burned the field to save our family,\
Each trying to escape a lightless destiny..

At the last moment\
I turned back for the wristwatch Father gave me.\
The second hand twitched,\
A message through space and time.

Father—\
Through the tesseract of a black hole,\
Banging on an interdimensional bookshelf,\
Begging me to make him stay.

Father—\
Fingertips outstretched towards the cosmos\
Traveling lightspeed amidst the galaxies,\
Not "Them" but "Us".

Father—\
Sending me the secrets of the black hole,\
The data of the world's deepest mystery\
Decoded in Morse beneath my fingertips.

*Eureka!*

And the papers took flight like white doves.\
I see him now,\
The ghost who always watched me,\
Loved me.

#### III. *Everything takes longer than you think it will.*

Our twin wristwatches fall back into step\
Before I fade into another galaxy.

My eyes crinkle as Father enters the room.\
I become a girl again in his arms,\
Starry-eyed like the glow of Saturn’s rings.

*Stay*, I want to say,\
But instead I say *Go*.

A variable disappearing from an equation,\
Knowing the answer to Plan B was still out there,\
Waiting to be found.

Entropy pulls us apart in an expanding universe,\
His silhouette fading into nebulous stars.

A promise\
Faded and patched over again:\
A ghost’s shadow dancing at my fingertips.

---

As I close my eyes,\
Life rewinds in startling clarity,\
Light speeding towards a black hole\
Drifting inescapably.

In these moments of timeless infinity,\
It is Father’s face that flashes before me,\
Father’s sleeve that I reach for and grasp.

Except this time,\
It is me who lets go.\
Enveloped in the light of a collapsing neutron star,\
Smiling as I bid my final goodbye.
