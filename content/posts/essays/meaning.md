*An unpolished thought dump in response to "What is meaning?"*

Meaning, in my understanding, is the gestalt or Aristotelian theory that the sum is greater than its parts. When people say they are searching for a meaning to life, they are actually talking about the search for a higher level objective (the sum) than simply the day to day action of staying alive (the parts). It is more easily described in the abstract: a book possesses more value than its constituent letters, a memory is more vivid than simply a train of thoughts marching along.

The history of humanity, at its core, has been a search for meaning. It is what philosophers in Greco-Roman society dwelled on, it is disguised as the ultimate question within heroic epics and fables and, more explicitly, koans, it is what drives us to stay on the pursuit of living. Plainly stated, this question is: Is there really an underlying meaning to reality?

The first question that comes to mind is whether or not there is an inherent meaning to things we view as having meaning. Is there meaning in language, or is it the firing of neurons that interprets the language? Is there meaning in DNA, or is it the cellular mechanisms that translate and interpret the DNA? Is there meaning in a math equation, or is it the context in which it is interpreted to describe a physical law?

Tennessee Williams describes this expressionism view of subjective reality, one that only exists in one’s mind, in *The Glass Menagerie*:

> “Everyone should know nowadays the unimportance of the photographic in art: that truth, life, or reality is an organic thing which the poetic imagination can represent or suggest, in essence, only through transformation, through changing into other forms than those which were merely present in appearance.”

The consistent view that reality only exists within ourselves, and cannot be separated from ourselves, is somehow deeply troubling. It is as if we are committing a circular reasoning fallacy: I believe in the concreteness of reality because reality is created by my beliefs. Or, it is like stating “The definition of meaning is meaning”, which clearly is in itself meaningless.

Then we get to the remaining question: Is there a meaning that “bottoms out”? As in, is there an inherent meaning to the universe? To answer this, I again turn to similar questions: Is there really one definitive, smallest subatomic particle? Is there anything really concrete and physical among repulsive and attractive forces? If I touch this table, at the bottom of all the abstractions is there really an “entity” that I am touching? I believe the answer may be no. It is like defining a recursive loop, a Fibonacci sequence, where there is no initial statement such as `if n=0: a=0` `if n=1: a=1`. It simply may be infinite, or inaccessible, just like our chemistry and cells and neurons are to our consciousness.


It seems like we are going nowhere with our search for meaning, because meaning, like everything else, is just a figment of our imagination. It is like reading the same book and coming to different meanings of the text. Maybe the text does have an inherent meaning, which the author intended, or a reference frame such as an infinitely intellectual entity which somehow establishes this true meaning. And maybe the universe too has an inherent meaning, if there is a creator and higher being who initialized the universe, who can say for certain what was meant by this world around us. But the search is futile because we can never know the answer.

In the absence of meaning without interpretation, meaning without an end, meaning without an answer, meaning simply becomes a subjective reality. Meaning, then, is the conscious decision to see life with a meaning. It is to see order within chaos, to construct a context in which meaningless symbols have a definition. It is to choose to speak a language which you know is at once subjective, incomplete, and yet gives you the power to keep living, to communicate with others who choose to speak their own, slightly different, interpretations of this language, all of which resides in your own mind which is itself a higher level representation of symbols in which you cannot see the bottom of -- only simply say that it means something, something more, to you.
